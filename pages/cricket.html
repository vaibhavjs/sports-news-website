            <p class="card-description">You've got to hand it to England: this Bazball thing sort of works. Even if you don't like it, or what it's called, and you feel it undermines the pillars of patience and pragmatism on which Test cricket is built, you have to admit that it gets things moving. For example, if you had any concerns about this match being drawn when it was reduced to three days, you needn't have.</p>
